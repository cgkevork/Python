# Now that we've processed JSON, moved into into a database an set up some helpful 
# prewritten queries for new records, we're going to talk about the flip side of that: 
# exporting data to JSON for use elsewhere.

# PROBLEM: We have some cool crime data and have set up the automated analysis
# of weekly records for interesting trends we may want to keep regular tabs
# on. It all comes with coordinates, though; why don't we use that to our
# advantage and generate some stuff we can actually see?

# HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT:
#   - Query our database, crawl through the rows of results to make a GeoJSON
#     file of points from scratch for display when connected to a Leaflet map.
#   - Query our database again while going through an existing GeoJSON and
#     adding data to it, that way we can display the result.
