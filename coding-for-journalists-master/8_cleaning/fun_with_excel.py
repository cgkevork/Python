# Excel still has a place in your work life with Python. People have written
# libraries so that you can read and write the modern XML-based file format
# for Microsoft Excel. Note: xlrd and xlwt exist for older Excel formats (.xls)



# Let's create an Excel workbook.


# It starts with a default sheet (called 'Sheet') but let's make another.


# Print the names of the sheets in this new, unsaved workbook.


# Set this new sheet to be the active sheet.


# Print the name of the active sheet.


# We'll select this new sheet (again) and start adding some basic data to it.


# If we dislike the title, we can change it.


# Let's assign the first three columns of the workbook some header names.




# We can retrieve values in cells in a similar manner.


# Let's make a list of values to put into the second row, right underneath.





# We can also comb through rows and get the output.



# One catch: it's basically all in memory until we write the workbook to disk.
