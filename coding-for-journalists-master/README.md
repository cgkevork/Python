This class is an evolving introduction to coding and the Python programming language for journalists. In addition to a tour of the fundamentals, it spans four basic projects to get you started.

* A guide and all documentation live at [coding-for-journalists.rtfd.org](http://coding-for-journalists.rtfd.org)
* The GitHub repository that includes all code is available from [github.com/ireapps/coding-for-journalists](https://github.com/ireapps/coding-for-journalists)
* A good place to raise issues with the code or ask specific questions about the code is [also on GitHub](https://github.com/ireapps/coding-for-journalists/issues)
